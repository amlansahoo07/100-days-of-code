# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 Log

### Day 1: May 10, 2021, Monday
#### Time of Updation: 02:00 IST (11-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Started with learning of the basics and getting familiarized with the syntax of Java from HackerRank platform.  

**Keynote**: Learnt that to input string immediately after an integer input, an extra Scanner.nextLine() is required in between to buffer out the last newline character for that line of integer.

**Thoughts**: Learning Java kinda forcefully. But it's okay. I hope I'm able to continue with the challenge properly this time.

### Day 2: May 11, 2021, Tuesday
#### Time of Updation: 03:00 IST (12-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Java practice problems on HackerRank. Learnt about some Java specific concepts.

**Keynote**: Use of static in Java. Use of Scanner.hasNext(). Java datatypes.

**Thoughts**: Need to get more concentration while coding. Panic's slowly kicking in. Have to start studying and weaving in the Java concepts together.

### Day 3: May 12, 2021, Wednesday
#### Time of Updation: 02:00 IST (13-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Java practice problems on HackerRank. Learnt about some java classes for currency formatting and Date Time. Also started with Strings on Java.

**Keynote**: Java Date and Time, LocalDate, Calendar, NumberFormat, Locale, substring in Java.

**Thoughts**: I've started using the discussion forum where solutions are posted. Don't like it particularly but had to because the classes and concepts were very particular. And fuck Java. Already getting on my nerves. Should have had paid attention in the LIT classes.

### Day 4: May 13, 2021, Thursday
#### Time of Updation: 00:30 IST (14-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Java practice problems related to Strings.

**Keynote**: String class and StringBuilder class, boolean values work different in Java - integer values not acceptable booleans, String can't be iterated as an array in Java

**Thoughts**: Java strings are different from the way they work in C++. Took some while to figure out their implementation. Only three questions done today. Ok bye.
