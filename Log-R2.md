# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 Log

### Day 1: May 10, 2021, Monday
#### Time of Updation: 02:00 IST (11-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Started with learning of the basics and getting familiarized with the syntax of Java from HackerRank platform.  

**Keynote**: Learnt that to input string immediately after an integer input, an extra Scanner.nextLine() is required in between to buffer out the last newline character for that line of integer.

**Thoughts**: Learning Java kinda forcefully. But it's okay. I hope I'm able to continue with the challenge properly this time.

### Day 2: Sep 8, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Designed and Simulated Full Subtractor and 4x1 MUX in Verilog in Xilinx ISE. 

**Thoughts**: I had hoped to finish the Verilog codes and watch some Data Science tutorials but entirety of my time got spent in the assignment. I'm glad tho that finally I understood how to work with Verilog and Xilinx.
