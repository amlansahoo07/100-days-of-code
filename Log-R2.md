# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 Log

### Day 1: May 10, 2021, Monday
#### Time of Updation: 02:00 IST (11-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Started with learning of the basics and getting familiarized with the syntax of Java from HackerRank platform.  

**Keynote**: Learnt that to input string immediately after an integer input, an extra Scanner.nextLine() is required in between to buffer out the last newline character for that line of integer.

**Thoughts**: Learning Java kinda forcefully. But it's okay. I hope I'm able to continue with the challenge properly this time.

### Day 2: May 11, 2021, Tuesday
#### Time of Updation: 03:00 IST (12-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Java practice problems on HackerRank. Learnt about some Java specific concepts.

**Keynote**: Use of static in Java. Use of Scanner.hasNext(). Java datatypes.

**Thoughts**: Need to get more concentration while coding. Panic's slowly kicking in. Have to start studying and weaving in the Java concepts together.

### Day 3: May 12, 2021, Wednesday
#### Time of Updation: 02:00 IST (13-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Java practice problems on HackerRank. Learnt about some java classes for currency formatting and Date Time. Also started with Strings on Java.

**Keynote**: Java Date and Time, LocalDate, Calendar, NumberFormat, Locale, substring in Java.

**Thoughts**: I've started using the discussion forum where solutions are posted. Don't like it particularly but had to because the classes and concepts were very particular. And fuck Java. Already getting on my nerves. Should have had paid attention in the LIT classes.

### Day 4: May 13, 2021, Thursday
#### Time of Updation: 00:30 IST (14-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Java practice problems related to Strings.

**Keynote**: String class and StringBuilder class, boolean values work different in Java - integer values not acceptable booleans, String can't be iterated as an array in Java

**Thoughts**: Java strings are different from the way they work in C++. Took some while to figure out their implementation. Only three questions done today. Ok bye.

### Day 5: May 14, 2021, Friday
#### Time of Updation: 01:00 IST (15-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Practiced just one problem related to deciding if two strings are anagram. Learnt about Hashmaps in the process.

**Keynote**: charAt(index), HashMap

**Thoughts**: Wasted a lot of my time being distracted today. Ended up learning all about Hashmaps to implement key value pairs for detecting anagrams only to realize the code editor wouldn't allow me to import HashMap library. Therefore didn't feel like carrying on and did only one question.

### Day 6: May 15, 2021, Saturday
#### Time of Updation: 01:25 IST (16-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Practiced strings problem based on regex operations. Learnt about regex validation using Pattern.compile() and Exception handling in the process.

**Keynote**: trim(), split(), regex, Pattern.compile(), try{}catch(){}

**Thoughts**: Was very tired and sleepy. Yet the will to pursue the challenge helped me put in 1 hour of coding practice. That's the best part about this challenge.

### Day 7: May 16, 2021, Sunday
#### Time of Updation: 02:50 IST (17-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Continued with a couple more regex problems such as IP and username validation.

**Keynote**: regex, regex format - ^, //d, etc.

**Thoughts**: No thoughts. Need to get better.

### Day 8: May 17, 2021, Monday
#### Time of Updation: 01:00 IST (18-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Finished with String and regex based problems.

**Keynote**: regex Pattern - compile() and matcher(), regex Matcher - find() and group()

**Thoughts**: Regex is very hard to understand and I'm not sure I'll be able to write a regex expression without taking the help on Internet.

### Day 9: May 18, 2021, Tuesday
#### Time of Updation: 02:00 IST (19-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Cheat Day - Attempted Amazon OT

**Keynote**: C++, Strings, Trees

**Thoughts**: I never imagined I'd be able to solve all the ouptut questions. Were easy tho. Attempted coding questions with help of Internet. 1st one fully completed. 2nd one 2/7 test cases passed. I think my performance was decent but I know it's not enough for an Interview call-up. Neither am I fit enough for an Amazon SDE role. I think I fucked up in the reasoning part the most. But I think I'm content with my performance in the test.

### Day 10: May 19, 2021, Wednesday
#### Time of Updation: 03:25 IST (20-05-21)

**Today's Progress**: Java BigNumber

**Keynote**: BigDecimal, BigInteger, isProbablePrime, Arrays.sort, @override

**Thoughts**: Did little for today as I got endsems. Gotta sleep.
