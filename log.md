# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 25, 2020, Monday
[comment]:##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Had an overview about the C++ Standard Template Library. Read about templates, algorithms of STL and about the vector container class. Coded four practice problems from Geeks For Geeks on STL.

**Thoughts**: I initially figured out how to proceed with studying was all pumped up. Midway through, I felt tired and towards the end I had a heavy head. I spent more time on reading the concepts rather than coding. The commitment towards the challenge helped me push myslef to achieve the target for Day 1 even though I was tired.

### Day 2: May 26, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I read about some more container classes. And I tried two coding questions today. I was able to solve the question on STL vector. But I really got stuck in the second question on STL vector of nested pairs. There was a simple boolean comparison logic which didn't strike my mind. I think it's because I have not properly understood the third parameter of sort() and the concept of sorting according to pair values. I finally referred to the solution to solve the second problem. I still made syntax mistakes which took me a couple of minutes more to submit the solution.

**Thoughts**: I was feeling very tired when I started. It was late in the evening. But then I had coffee and after reading the concepts I had my dinner. I then felt light headed and went on with solving some coding problems. I could solve the first one but the second one really got me stuck. I got very frustrated and since it was getting late I decided to view the solution. Hope this doesn't repeat often.

### Day 3: May 27, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I devoted the entire day to practice coding questions on list,stack,queues in STL(one from each). I also solved a problem on implementing a queue using array and implenting a queue using two stacks. I made silly and common mistakes such as missing out a colon, or mixing variable names and segmentation fault due to improper return types. 
I also tried out a worksheet on methods and function in Python from Jose Portilla's Udemy course. But even there I couldn't solve everything.

**Thoughts**: I had a very slow and frustrating start to the day. I could do only 5 easy level questions the entire day. So that is kinda discouraging. I had to refer to solutions more often. I need to improve. Also today really is a very frustrating day and even my temper got me today which normally doesn't happen. Maybe that affected my coding. I really gotta keep working hard and improve my standards. Right now I need to get some sleep as I could only get around 4 hours of sleep the previous day.

### Day 4: May 28, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: For most of the day I was working on the Python methods and functions worksheet from Udemy. I started learing Python from udemy a while ago and plan to finish it ASAP. That's why I'm doing it sidewise along with Competitive Coding. Today I just finished reading about the STL containers. Practiced two Basic problems on map and set container classes.

**Thoughts**: Today was a slow paced day. Kuni Mamu was here so didn't study much throughout the day. I am not following the #100DaysOfCode for Python cause I don't want to spend that much amount of time on it. Rather I plan to start #100DayOfMLCode as soon as I finish the Python tutorial.

### Day 5: May 29, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the C++ STL set of practice questions dealing with the basics of STL container classes. Tried a medium level problem on arrays and stuck in it. Deduced a logic in O[n^2] time complexity and the problem obviously asked for better. Referred to a solution in time order O[n]. Implemented it correctly(not 100% sure) and run custom test cases successfully. But it was still not accepted. Need to sort it out tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Not much thoughts for today. Could solve the basic level container class questions comparatively faster than the previous days. Got stuck in a problem which I will try to figure out tomorrow. It seems highly like an error from the submission rules side.
