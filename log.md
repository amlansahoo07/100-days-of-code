### Day 1: May 26, 2020 
[comment]:##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Had an overview about the C++ Standard Template Library. Read about templates, algorithms of STL and about the vector container class. Coded four practice problems from Geeks For Geeks on STL.

**Thoughts:** I initially figured out how to proceed with studying was all pumped up. Midway through, I felt tired and towards the end I had a heavy head. I spent more time on reading the concepts rather than coding. The commitment towards the challenge helped me push myslef to achieve the target for Day 1 even though I was tired.

**Link(s) to work:** 
1. [Sort and Reverse Vector](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sort-and-reverse-vector/1)
2. [Find the frequency](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-frequency/1/)
3. [Front to Back](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/front-to-back/1/)
4. [Back to Front](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/back-to-front/1/)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.-->
