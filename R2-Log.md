# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 Log

### Day 1: Sep 7, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed an assigment on ResNets from Coursera's Convolutional Neural Network Course

**Thoughts**: I am very excited to start this journey again. I am looking forward to learn the things I want without any other thing holding me back. Today I had some college assignments due for midnight. Hence I could only complete a single assignment from Coursera.
