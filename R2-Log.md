# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 Log

### Day 1: Sep 7, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed an assigment on ResNets from Coursera's Convolutional Neural Network Course.

**Thoughts**: I am very excited to start this journey again. I am looking forward to learn the things I want without any other thing holding me back. Today I had some college assignments due for midnight. Hence I could only complete a single assignment from Coursera.

### Day 2: Sep 8, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Designed and Simulated Full Subtractor and 4x1 MUX in Verilog in Xilinx ISE. 

**Thoughts**: I had hoped to finish the Verilog codes and watch some Data Science tutorials but entirety of my time got spent in the assignment. I'm glad tho that finally I understood how to work with Verilog and Xilinx.

### Day 9: Sep 15, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I had to see some C++ programming concepts and pseudo codes to solve a question set.

**Thoughts**: Had to help a friend, so my time went away doing the DSA and pseudo code questions. Felt like a wasted day cause it was very random. Would avoid such things in future.
